# Setting Up a Development Environment for the PFX Pipeline

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up a development environment tailored to the PFX Pipeline. It includes installing necessary software, creating virtual environments, configuring tools, and organizing your workspace to ensure efficient development and integration with the PFX Pipeline infrastructure.

## Install Required Software

To begin, you'll need tools for version control, an IDE for Python development, and the appropriate Python versions. Follow these steps to install and configure the required software.

1. **Git Client (e.g., SourceTree)**
   
   - **SourceTree**: A user-friendly Git client with a graphical interface for managing repositories.
   
   - [Download SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) and follow the installation instructions.
     
     > Alternatively, you can use other Git tools or the Git command-line interface if preferred.

2. **PyCharm**
   
   - **PyCharm** is a powerful IDE tailored for Python development, offering features like debugging, code navigation, and virtual environment management.
   - [Download PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
   - Install and follow the installation instructions.

3. **Required Python Versions**
   
   - Visit [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the required versions: 3.7, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.
   - Ensure you download the correct version for your operating system (Windows 64-bit).
   - Install each Python version one by one. During installation:
     - Choose the **Customize installation** option.
     - Set the installation path to `C:\PythonXX` (e.g., `C:\Python37` for Python 3.7).
     - For all versions, uncheck the "Add Python to PATH" option during installation.

## Setting Up the Development Folder and Connect Repositories

1. **Create Personal Development Folder**
   
   - Navigate to the `R` drive and locate the `prod` folder.
   
   - Copy the `prod` folder and paste it in the root of the `R` drive.
   
   - Rename the copied folder using a three-letter abbreviation of your name (e.g., `jdo` for John Doe).
     
     This will serve as your isolated development environment.

2. **To-Do: SSH Setup**

3. **Setting Up Repositories in SourceTree**
   
    To start working with the repositories within the copied folder, you need to add them to your Git client (e.g., SourceTree) and ensure they are properly linked with GitLab and GitHub.
   
    Below is the list of repositories that are part of the `prod` folder:
   
   - **GitLab (https://github.com/pfxtv):**
     
     - `R:\jdo\wind`
   
   - **GitHub (https://gitlab.com/currentpipe):**
     
     - `R:\jdo\studio\studio_library`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\sc`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\blender`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\clarisse`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\equalizer`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\hiero`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\houdini`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\max`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\maya`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\nuke`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\painter`
     - `R:\jdo\studio\resolve`

4. **Add Repositories to SourceTree**
   
   For each repository in the list:
   
   - Open SourceTree and click **Add**.
   
   - Point SourceTree to its local directory in your development folder and click **Add**
     
     ![source_tree_1.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenglichPFX/install_doc/refs/heads/main/doc/source_tree_1.png)
   
   - Navigate to **Repository > Repository Settings > Add** 
   
   - Add the corresponding GitLab/GitHub URL to the Remote details and click **OK**.
     
     ![source_tree_2.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenglichPFX/install_doc/refs/heads/main/doc/source_tree_2.png)

5. **Pull the Latest Changes**
   
   - For each repository added to SourceTree, select the repository and click **Pull** to fetch the latest updates from the remote origin.

## Create a PyCharm Project and Interpreters

1. **Create a PyCharm Project**
   
   - Launch PyCharm and select **New Project** from the welcome screen. If PyCharm is already open, go to **File > New Project**.
   - In the **New Project** dialog, set the project location to: `C:\Users\john.doe\pipeline_dev`

2. **Create a New Virtual Environment**
   
   - Under the **Python Interpreter** section, select **Custom Environment**.
   
   - Choose **Generate New > Type: Virtualenv**.
   
   - For **Base Python** choose `C:\Python37\python.exe`.
   
   - Set the **Environment Location** to: `C:\Users\<YourName>\pipeline_dev\.venv\python37`.
   
   - Ensure the **Inherit global site-packages** option is unchecked for a clean environment.
     
     ![pycharm_1.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenglichPFX/install_doc/refs/heads/main/doc/pycharm_1.png)

3. **Complete Project Setup**
   
   - Click **Create** to initialize the project and virtual environment. PyCharm will set up the environment and link it to the project.

4. **Open Interpreter Settings**
   
   - Navigate to **File > Settings > Project: [pipeline_dev] > Python Interpreter**.
   
   - Click **Add interpreter** next to the Python Interpreter and select **Add Local Interpreter**.
   
   - Create a virtual environment with the above settings adjusted for Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

5. **Creating a Python 2.7 Virtual Environment Manually**
   
   - Due to compatibility issues, PyCharm may encounter errors when attempting to create a virtual environment for Python 2.7. To address this, you can manually create the virtual environment and then configure PyCharm to use it.
   
   - Create a virtual environment named `python27` by running:
     
     ```
     C:\Python27\python.exe -m virtualenv C:\Users\john.doe\pipeline_dev\.venv\python27
     ```
   
   - Add `C:\Users\<YourName>\pipeline_dev\.venv\python27\Scripts\python.exe` to your PyCharm interpreters by choosing **Add interpreter > Select Existing**.

>  You should now have a virtual environment for each required Python version added as an interpreter in your PyCharm project. This setup ensures that you can seamlessly switch between different Python versions as needed.
